# Bot One Repo

A collection of bot projects that I've done (or am working on) big and small. Mostly for Twitter but there may be some others mixed in there as well.

## Getting Started

Most of these projects run on NodeJS so if you want to use them make sure you have that installed as well. Node_modules folder contains all the necessary npm nodes necessary for the projects. See the descriptions of the projects below.
